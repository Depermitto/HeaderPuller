#+title: Cross-platform header-only package manager for C/C++

* Install
Provided you have *go* installed, use this oneliner in the command-line:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/Depermitto/HeaderPuller && cd ./HeaderPuller && go build -o $GOPATH/bin/hp
#+end_src

* Capabilites
- pull, p       - pull headers in specified folder
- uninstall, u  - Removes the hp tool

** Pull
There are 3 variations of this command:
1. pull *repo-link* - providing the repo link will copy every valid fileFmt from *repo-link*\/include/ to ./include/
2. pull *repo-link* *filename* - will copy that exact *filename* if valid from *repo-link* to ./include/
3. pull *repo-link* *from* - will copy every valid fileFmt from *repo-link/*from*/ to ./*from*, which is by default ./include/

** Uninstall
Upon confirmation, wipes *hp* from the computer entirely

* TODO
- [ ] Update README to the newest version of software
- [X] Fix <repo-link>/<header> pulling (e.g. [[https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio][miniaudio]])
- [X] Implement wiping whole *hp.yaml*
