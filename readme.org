** Pull
There are 3 variations of this command:
1. pull *repo-link* - providing the repo link will copy every valid fileFmt from *repo-link*/include/ to ./include/
2. pull *repo-link* *fileFmt* - will copy that exact fileFmt if valid from *repo-link*/*fileFmt* to ./include/
3. pull *repo-link* *from* - will copy every valid fileFmt from *repo-link/*from*/ to ./*from*, which is by default ./include/

** Unintall
Upon confirmation, wipes *hp* from the computer entirely
